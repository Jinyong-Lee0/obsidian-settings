## I use this theme

- AnuPpuccin

## What has changed with my CSS setting?

I only looked at the dark theme based on it, so it may not be right for people who use light themes.

1. Based on the dark theme, I changed the main background color (editor) to black and the letters to white.
2. Cleared the folder icon on MAKE.md and set the file name to white.
3. Dataview adjusted the task margin and set the sub-task to be distinct.
4. Only two lines of data view output in the form of a list. In addition, the #todoist and link tags added to Ultimate toist sync have been set to be invisible.
5. Callout fetched a minimal-themed callout-outline.
6. In Calendar, it was marked pink on Saturday and red on Sunday. Also, today's date has been changed to a translucent black background, making it distinct.

- This depends on whether you've made the first week start day setting and show week number.
- If you want to indicate the show week number, please increase the number in parentheses by 1 among td:nth-child(7) and td:nth-child(1) in calendar-plugin.css.

7. The heading color is from AnuPuccin. The background color is the addition of alpha values of the colors set in each heading hierarchy. We also added up and down margins using the border.
8. The left line of the quoto has been set thick.
9. I set the highlight color to be slightly red.
10. In the check box, p and r are set to show a specific emoji.

If you post any other questions or additional requests on the issue, I will help you as soon as I can and as much as I can.
